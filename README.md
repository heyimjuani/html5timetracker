html5timetracker
================

Forked from the good work of heyimjuani, but adds various features.

So far:
- Support for tasks longer than one hour
- Continue timing until task is actually logged (in case you ignore the alarm)
- Copy tasks to TSV (to paste into OpenOffice spreadsheet)
- Keyboard support (enter and esc)
